# How to ?

Hi! I'd love to have your contributions!

## üêõ Bugs report

Testing game mods is time-consuming so you might not realize it, but a good way to support this mod is simply to report any bug found by simply filing a [Github issue](https://github.com/cyb3rpsych0s1s/4ddicted/issues).

## üí° Suggestions

If you want to suggest a feature, please open a [Github Discussion](https://github.com/cyb3rpsych0s1s/4ddicted/discussions) and let's talk about it!

I'm welcome to suggestions as long as they match with my own vision of the mod: being lore-friendly and immersive.

> Also I'm doing this on my free time without any retribution, so be respectful of my time and temper your expectations :)
