An amplifier mod based on `Toxicity` and `WE3D - Drugs in Night City`.
Basically adds a chance to become addicted to substances too frequently consumed, like MAXdoc and the likes.

- `just build`: copy files from your dev environment to the game directory
- `just deploy`: run redscript cli to redeploy mod
