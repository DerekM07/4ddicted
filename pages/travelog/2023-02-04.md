## Learning about the different kind of ink game controllers

credits from psiberx:

> inkGameController has a ref to library
>
> inkLogicController has a ref to game controller (kind of)
>
> what controller can spawn is defined by the library:
>
> - library items defined in the library itself
> - library items from external libs that are listed in the special section

and later on added:

> inkGameController connects widget library item to ink layer / window, it provides access to game instance, library animations, sounds (can be attached to a library item)
>
> inkLogicController is a lightweight controller that doesn't > have access to game or resources functions (can be attached > to any widget)
>
> those are fundamental, others derive from them
