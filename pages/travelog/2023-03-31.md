# customSounds

Custom sounds can be added to the game with REDmod.

- unrelated to **Pack as REDmod** or **Pack**, both works
  > .archive and customSounds are distinct
- if mod was both **Pack**ed and **Packed as REDmod**,
  files under `archive/pc/mod` (ArchiveXL) takes precedence over files in `mods` (REDmod).

- must be copied over into:
  - `{install}/mods/{my-mod}/customSounds` (all your .wav)
  - `{install}/mods/{my-mod}/info.json`
- requires run `deploy` on REDmod cli whenever changed
  REDmod cli can be found in game's files `{install}/tools/redmod/bin/redMod.exe`
  (see `deploy` command in justfile)
- requires game settings: `-modded`

### encoding

.wav works in 44100Hz 16bits mono (pcm_s16le in ffmpeg).

### packaging

it's perfectly fine to **Pack** normally in WolvenKit,
while still using REDmod for custom sounds on the side.

The following warnings on **Pack** .archive can safely be ignored. REDmod will still load the custom sounds if found in the game files, as previously mentioned.

### translations

files in `customSounds` can perfectly be nested in subdirectories,
allowing (separate mods included) to prepare voices for translations,
under e.g. `en-us/`.

### localization

[Codeware](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-codeware) also provides
[LocalizationSystem](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-codeware/wiki/Localization-System)
to easily handle translations of any kind: voice, subtitle, etc.
